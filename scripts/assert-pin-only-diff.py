"""Refuse a unified diff that changes anything but a dependency pin.

Read a diff on stdin (`gh pr diff <n> | scripts/assert-pin-only-diff.py`) and
exit non-zero unless every changed file is one of the pin surfaces below and
every changed line differs from its counterpart in nothing but a version.

Ported from ivan-pinatti-labs/rsync-crypt's script of the same name, itself
ported from docker-torrent-box-with-vpn's script, which is the check that
stands between "renovate[bot] opened a pull request" and an unattended
merge. `dependabot[bot]` stood in that same sentence until Dependabot's
`.github/dependabot.yml` `updates:` config was deleted and every ecosystem
it managed moved to Renovate's own native managers (see
docs/MERGE_PIPELINE.md, "A dependency bot pull request"). It exists here
for the same reason: approving a bot's
pull request on the strength of its author means the bot identity holds
write access to main, and a diff that is not actually pin-only is exactly
the shape a compromised or misconfigured bot would take. A path allowlist
alone would not be much of a fence, since `.github/workflows/` and
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` are executable surfaces on their own; the line
comparison below is what makes it one.

The comparison normalizes both sides and requires them to match line for
line per file, duplicates counted. A line whose structure changed has no
counterpart and the diff is refused, which covers
`uses: actions/checkout@v7` becoming `uses: evil/checkout@v7` as much as it
covers an added `curl | sh`. Anything this refuses is not broken, it just
waits for a person: the approval is skipped and the pull request sits there,
which is the direction to fail in.

What it deliberately does not catch: a bump to a version that exists but is
malicious. `pre-commit 4.5.1` becoming `pre-commit 4.6.2` is the change this
file exists to permit, and no amount of diff reading can tell a good release
from a backdoored one. Renovate's minimumReleaseAge window in
.github/renovate.json5 is the actual defence against that; see
docs/MERGE_PIPELINE.md.

`requirements.txt` is on ALLOWED_PATHS as of 2026-09-03, and it was not
before. It was excluded on the grounds that pip installs execute arbitrary
code, which is true, but the exclusion was standing in for a test gate this
repository did not have: a bump there failed this assertion, fell through to
the human review lane, and waited. #1, a pyyaml patch bump, sat that way from
2026-08-17.

What changed is that the gate now exists. `tests/test_check_disk_usage.py`
runs as the required `Tests` context, and its
`test_load_config_parses_the_shipped_config` reads the real `config.yaml`
through `check_disk_usage.load_config`, the one place this project calls into
yaml. So a pyyaml bump is exercised by the new pyyaml before it can merge,
which is what makes fast-tracking the surface defensible rather than merely
convenient. Confirmed the gate bites: with pyyaml uninstalled the suite fails
at collection, and a parse returning the wrong mapping fails that test.

The Dockerfile's `FROM python:3.12-slim` pin stays off the list, and for an
unrelated reason: the bot does not manage it (see renovate.json5's comment
on `extends:`), so there is no bot-authored diff touching it to grade.

Renovate is the only dependency bot with write access to this repository as
of 2026-09-08. `.github/dependabot.yml` used to also open pull requests
against `.github/workflows/`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml` and both
requirements files, on a separate set of ecosystems, until its `updates:`
config was deleted and every one of those surfaces moved to Renovate's own
native managers (see docs/MERGE_PIPELINE.md, "A dependency bot pull
request"). Nothing below shrank when it left: Renovate's native managers
write into the same files.

#
# `==` and nothing looser. Both requirements files in this repository pin
# exactly (see tests/requirements.txt for why), so a bump that also changed
# the operator, `pyyaml==6.0.2` becoming `pyyaml>=6.0.3`, is a change of
# policy rather than of version and should read as structural and be refused.
# The optional bracket group covers an extras pin like `requests[socks]==2.34.2`
# without letting the name itself grow or shrink.
#
# The version still has to satisfy RELEASE, so `pyyaml==main` cannot normalize

# deliberately not matched: anything after the version is left as ordinary text

# A pre-commit hook `rev:`. The prefix is captured and put back, so that a
# pin changing shape rather than value still reads as a difference.
#
# GitHub Actions pins are handled separately below rather than through this
# same released-version grammar: this repository pins every action to a
# full commit SHA rather than a tag (see any `uses:` line in
# .github/workflows/), so the immutable shape to require there is a SHA,
# not a release number.
REV_PIN = re.compile(r"(?P<prefix>\brev:[ \t]+)" + RELEASE)

# A GitHub Actions pin, always a full 40 character commit SHA in this
# repository (the dependency bot updates it that way), optionally followed
# by a trailing release comment (`# v7`, `# v7.0.1`), which the bot rewrites
# on the same bump whenever the tag it resolves the SHA from changes. Both
# have to normalize together: normalizing only the SHA and leaving the
# comment as ordinary text means an ordinary bump that also moves `# v7` to
# `# v7.0.1` reads as a structural change and `Pin Only` refuses it, which
# is exactly what happened to every grouped GitHub Actions bump before
# ivan-pinatti-labs/github-template fixed this. The comment is folded into
# the same placeholder only when it is actually a release token; anything
# else after the SHA is left alone, so a change to unrelated trailing text
# is still caught as structural. The negative lookahead after the hex run
# stops a 40 character prefix of a longer hex run from matching and
# silently swallowing the character that would have made the shapes differ.
#
# Case-insensitive (`[0-9a-fA-F]`, not `[0-9a-f]`): GitHub resolves a `uses:`
# SHA the same way regardless of case, so an uppercase or mixed-case SHA is
# just as real a pin as a lowercase one, and matching only lowercase left a
# gap a CodeRabbit review of BARE_ACTION_VERSION below found: an uppercase
# SHA on a first-time pin's new side fell through ACTION_SHA entirely and
# was accepted by BARE_ACTION_VERSION's generic RELEASE grammar instead,
# which does not check that a first-time pin's target is SHA-shaped at all.
#
# Anchored to a genuine `uses:` field at the start of the line, the same
# anchor BARE_ACTION_VERSION uses, rather than a bare `@<sha>` matched
# anywhere: a follow-up CodeRabbit finding pointed out the original,
# unanchored ACTION_SHA matched a 40 character hex run on ANY changed
# workflow line, `run:` step content included, so a `run:` command could
# change while its normalized form stayed equal, as long as the line still
# ended in something SHA-shaped. `prefix` now captures the full
# `uses: owner/repo@` text, not only `@`, and `_normalize_action_pin`
# reuses that whole prefix unchanged, so the dependency name stays literal
# to the left exactly as it already did.
ACTION_SHA = re.compile(
    r"(?P<prefix>^(?:[ \t]*-[ \t]+)?[ \t]*uses:[ \t]+[\w.-]+/[\w./-]+@)"

# A first-time pinDigests bump changes `uses: actions/checkout@v7` to
# `uses: actions/checkout@<sha> # v7` in one step, with no prior SHA to
# compare against, and the trailing release comment appearing for the
# first time alongside it. ACTION_SHA above normalizes the pinned side to
# `@<version> # <version>` whenever a comment trails the SHA, which every
# first-time pin carries in practice (proven on docker-torrent-box-with-vpn's
# own PR #178, where Renovate never added a bare SHA with no comment on
# this update type). This pattern gives the unpinned side the identical
# placeholder, so the two sides of a first-time pin compare equal the same
# way an ordinary SHA-to-SHA bump does. A first-time pin whose comment is
# missing still reads as structural and gets refused, the correct,
# fail-closed outcome for a shape that never happens on a clean bump.
#
# Scoped to a `uses:` field and an owner/repo coordinate immediately before
# the `@`, not bare `@RELEASE` anywhere on the line, per a CodeRabbit
# finding on docker-torrent-box-with-vpn's own version of this pattern:
# an unscoped version would let a `run:` step's own `tool@v7` normalize
# the same way, so that line could grow an unrelated-looking SHA and
# comment and still read as pin-only.
#
# `uses:` alone is not narrow enough, as a second CodeRabbit finding on
# this exact pattern went on to show: `\buses:` is a word-boundary check,
# not a position check, so it matches the substring "uses:" anywhere a
# line contains it, including inside a `run:` step's own text
# (`run: uses: actions/checkout@v7` normalized the same way a real `uses:`
# line did). Anchored to the start of the line instead, with only an
# optional YAML list marker (`- `) and indentation in front of `uses:`,
# which is the only place a real `uses:` field can sit.
#
# Applying ACTION_SHA first, ahead of this one, is what keeps the two from
# double matching an already-pinned line with no comment. RELEASE's
# character class is wide enough to also accept a 40 character hex run, but
# ACTION_SHA has already replaced that run with `<version>` by the time this
# pattern runs, and `<version>` does not start with a digit or a bare `v`.
#
# The version is its own capture group, `bare_version`, rather than folded
# unnamed into the match, because a third CodeRabbit-class finding (found by
# extending their own test, not reported directly) showed RELEASE alone is
# still too permissive here: `_normalize_bare_action_version` below refuses
# a 40 character match outright, real hex or not, because 40 characters is
# the shape ACTION_SHA exists to own exclusively. Without that check, a
# non-hex 40 character token, `0` followed by 39 `z`s for instance, never
# matches ACTION_SHA (not hex) and was accepted here instead, since nothing
# about this pattern's own grammar checked that the "version" replacing a
# first-time pin's bare tag was ever a real SHA at all, only that it was
# RELEASE-shaped. A real first-time pin's target is always exactly a 40
# character SHA, ACTION_SHA's exclusive domain, so anything that length
# reaching this pattern instead is already suspect, and refusing it outright
# costs nothing: a length that long never occurs in a genuine bare release
# tag either.

# missed `|2-` (digit before chomping) and a trailing `# comment`, either
# of which would have left a real block scalar unrecognized as one. A
# later review found it still missed a standalone sequence-item scalar
# header, `- |` with no `key:` in front at all, since the pattern required

    zero indentation must not be mistaken for the boundary that closes the
    scalar). Inside a block scalar if that nearer line opens one.
    Conservatively also inside one if no such line is visible at all: the

    that gap, but was tried and reverted: it also requires reaching the
    file's own top level (indentation zero) before a real diff's limited
    context ever earns a confident "not inside one", and no ordinary `gh

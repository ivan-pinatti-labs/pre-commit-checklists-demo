# checkmake reads only the first physical line of a .PHONY declaration and
# silently drops backslash continuations, so every .PHONY here is written on
# one line. Splitting one across lines leaves the trailing targets invisible
# to it, and the phonydeclared and minphony rules then report them as
# undeclared. Tracked upstream as checkmake#280.
.PHONY: all help test coverage workbench-help

# Bare `make` shows the target list rather than doing something surprising.
# checkmake's minphony rule also wants `all` declared phony; see checkmake.ini.

# The test suite, with its pinned requirements, in a virtual environment kept
# in L2's own per repository home, where it survives between runs and pip
# keeps it in step with requirements.txt and tests/requirements.txt. `l2
# --net` lets pip reach PyPI through the egress proxy; outside a workbench
# there is no l2, and the same commands run as they are.

# Coverage of everything this repository writes, held at 100%: the Python
# (lines and branches, .coveragerc) under coverage.py, and the shell (lines;
# kcov reports no branches for bash) under kcov. Writes the two reports
# SonarQube Cloud reads, $(COVERAGE_DIR)/coverage.xml and
# $(COVERAGE_DIR)/shell.xml, and fails if either language is under 100%.
# .github/workflows/sonarqube.yml runs this, and so does the `coverage`
# pre-push hook.
#
# Both tools run in containers that cannot see this checkout. The files git
# would commit (tracked, plus new ones not ignored) go in on standard input
# as a tar stream, and the only host path either container gets is an empty
# scratch directory for its report. Nothing else is mounted: no home
# directory, no SSH agent, no token, and podman passes no environment
# variable that is not named. Both drop every capability; kcov also gets no
# network and a read only root filesystem. The Python container needs the
# network for its pip install. The images are pinned by digest, and Renovate
# moves the digests.
#
# The scratch directory comes from mktemp, so it lands in TMPDIR. In a
# devcontainer-airlock workbench run this as `l2 --engine --net -- make
# coverage`: the engine can only mount paths under the TMPDIR it sets.
#
# Both reports are written before either verdict is given, so CI can still
# hand SonarQube the report of a run that falls short.

"""Refuse a unified diff that changes anything but a dependency pin.

Read a diff on stdin (`gh pr diff <n> | scripts/assert-pin-only-diff.py`) and
exit non-zero unless every changed file is one of the pin surfaces below and
every changed line differs from its counterpart in nothing but a version.

Ported from ivan-pinatti-labs/rsync-crypt's script of the same name, itself
ported from docker-torrent-box-with-vpn's script, which is the check that
stands between "renovate[bot] or dependabot[bot] opened a pull request" and
an unattended merge. It exists here for the same reason: approving a bot's
pull request on the strength of its author means the bot identity holds
write access to main, and a diff that is not actually pin-only is exactly
the shape a compromised or misconfigured bot would take. A path allowlist
alone would not be much of a fence, since `.github/workflows/` and
`.pre-commit-config.yaml` are executable surfaces on their own; the line
comparison below is what makes it one.

The comparison normalizes both sides and requires them to match line for
line per file, duplicates counted. A line whose structure changed has no
counterpart and the diff is refused, which covers
`uses: actions/checkout@v7` becoming `uses: evil/checkout@v7` as much as it
covers an added `curl | sh`. Anything this refuses is not broken, it just
waits for a person: the approval is skipped and the pull request sits there,
which is the direction to fail in.

What it deliberately does not catch: a bump to a version that exists but is
malicious. `pre-commit 4.5.1` becoming `pre-commit 4.6.2` is the change this
file exists to permit, and no amount of diff reading can tell a good release
from a backdoored one. Renovate's minimumReleaseAge window in
.github/renovate.json5 is the actual defence against that; see
docs/MERGE_PIPELINE.md.

This repository has a Dockerfile and a requirements.txt as well, unlike
ivan-pinatti-labs/github-template, but neither is on ALLOWED_PATHS below.
requirements.txt is Dependabot-maintained (see dependabot.yml's pip block)
but deliberately excluded: a bump there always fails this assertion and is
graded like a human pull request instead, which is the safe default for a
surface this port's mandate never asked to fast-track, and pip installs
execute arbitrary code same as the two ecosystems this file does cover. The
Dockerfile's `FROM python:3.12-slim` pin is unmanaged by either bot at all
(see renovate.json5's comment on `extends:`), so there is no bot-authored
diff touching it to grade in the first place.

# deliberately narrower than "any tag-shaped token": a floating ref like
# `main` or `latest` is made entirely of characters this would otherwise
# accept, and normalizing it the same as a real release would let a
# compromised bot trade an immutable pin for something that can move under
# it after the diff is already merged, with nothing left in the diff to
# catch it.

# lookbehind of variable width is not allowed and "the word after a space"
# would match most of a workflow file. It is matched whole-line instead, and
# only for that file, which is why normalize() takes the path. The value
# after the space has to be a real release, not merely non-blank:
# `pre-commit main` would otherwise normalize identically to
# `pre-commit 4.5.1`.

# pin changing shape rather than value still reads as a difference.
#
# GitHub Actions pins are handled separately below rather than through this
# same released-version grammar: this repository pins every action to a
# full commit SHA rather than a tag (see any `uses:` line in
# .github/workflows/), so the immutable shape to require there is a SHA,
# not a release number.

# A GitHub Actions pin, always a full 40 character commit SHA in this
# repository (Dependabot updates it that way), optionally followed by a
# trailing release comment (`# v7`, `# v7.0.1`), which Dependabot rewrites
# on the same bump whenever the tag it resolves the SHA from changes. Both
# have to normalize together: normalizing only the SHA and leaving the
# comment as ordinary text means an ordinary bump that also moves `# v7` to
# `# v7.0.1` reads as a structural change and `Pin Only` refuses it, which
# is exactly what happened to every grouped GitHub Actions bump before
# ivan-pinatti-labs/github-template fixed this. The comment is folded into
# the same placeholder only when it is actually a release token; anything
# else after the SHA is left alone, so a change to unrelated trailing text
# is still caught as structural. The negative lookahead after the hex run
# stops a 40 character prefix of a longer hex run from matching and
# silently swallowing the character that would have made the shapes differ.

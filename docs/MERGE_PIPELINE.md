# The Merge Pipeline

<!-- cspell:words coderabbit coderabbitai -->

What happens between opening a pull request against this repository and it
landing on `main`. Ported from `ivan-pinatti-labs/rsync-crypt`'s document of
the same name, trimmed to what this repository actually has: no app code and
no test suite, so there is no `Tests` context, unlike that repository. Where
the reasoning is identical it is only summarized, not restated; see
rsync-crypt's `docs/MERGE_PIPELINE.md` for the fuller version this one was
trimmed from, and `ivan-pinatti-labs/.github`'s `docs/MERGE_PIPELINE.md` for
a smaller worked example of the same kind of trim, for a repository with no
merge queue and no `Pin Only` at all. This repository sits closer to
`ivan-pinatti-labs/github-template`: both have a merge queue and a
dependency-bot fast lane despite having no test suite, so both carry
`Pin Only` and `bot-auto-merge.yml`'s full owner-approval and bot-approval
mechanics that `.github`'s copy does not need. Unlike that template, this
repository does have a Dockerfile, so it also carries a non-required
`Docker Build` job; see "Every required status context" below for why that
job is not on the required list.

## Every required status context

| Context | What it actually proves | Who publishes it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Pre-commit` | The full pre-commit hook set passed over every file | `pull-request.yml`, as a job |
| `Tests` | `pytest tests` passed, which is what exercises the pinned Python dependencies | `pull-request.yml`, as a job |
| `Pin Only` | A dependency bot's diff changes nothing but a version in a pin position; `success` with a "not a dependency bot pull request" description on everything else | `coderabbit-gate.yml`, published directly onto the head SHA |
| `Review Verified` | CodeRabbit's actual review outcome, not merely that it reported something | `coderabbit-gate.yml`, published directly onto the head SHA |

`Tests` exists so that `requirements.txt` can be a `Pin Only` surface. A
pyyaml bump merges here without a person reading it, and that is only
defensible because something runs the new pyyaml first:
`tests/test_check_disk_usage.py`'s
`test_load_config_parses_the_shipped_config` reads the real `config.yaml`
through `check_disk_usage.load_config`, the one place this project calls into
yaml. Before 2026-09-03 there was no such job, `requirements.txt` was
excluded from `Pin Only` in its place, and a pyyaml patch bump (#1) waited
for a human from 2026-08-17. The exclusion was standing in for this check.

`Pre-commit` and `Tests` are ordinary workflow jobs: GitHub reports a job's
own pass or fail as the check. The other two are commit statuses, written directly by a
workflow step rather than read off a job's outcome, for the same reason as
in rsync-crypt: a status a workflow chooses whether to write, and what to
write, does not read as passed merely because it was skipped.

`Docker Build`, a job in `pull-request.yml`, builds the Dockerfile standalone
and is deliberately not in this table: `checklist-dev-docker` already lints it with
hadolint on every pull request, this job only additionally proves it
actually builds, and nothing in this pipeline needs that proof to merge
anything. Unlike rsync-crypt's `Docker Build`, it does not log in to Docker
Hub: this repository has never carried `DOCKERHUB_USERNAME` or
`DOCKERHUB_TOKEN`, and pulling `python:3.12-slim` needs no credentials.

## A human pull request

Open it as a **draft** first. `Pre-commit` runs the full hook set over every
file, and CodeRabbit does not review a draft at all: `.coderabbit.yaml` sets
`drafts: false` on purpose, so a review is not spent on a diff the
mechanical linters have not finished cleaning up yet.

**Mark it ready for review** once `Pre-commit` is green. That is what starts
CodeRabbit. Address what it raises, pushing fixes as needed; each push
re-runs the job and gets a fresh review.

Once every required check reads green and a maintainer has approved it, the
pull request is eligible for the merge queue, but entering it still needs
someone to select **Merge when ready** (or enable auto-merge); nothing here
enqueues it on its own. Once enqueued, it merges when the queue's own run of
the same check set passes on the commit the queue actually builds; see "The
merge queue" below.

## The repository owner's own pull request

The owner is the only account with write access, and GitHub refuses to let
an account approve its own pull request, which would otherwise be a genuine
deadlock once the queue is live: `gh pr merge --admin` skips the queue
entirely, and arming auto-merge on an unapproved pull request leaves it
enqueued forever with no `merge_group` run, because `enforce_admins: false`
exempts the owner from performing a merge without approval, not from the
approval the queue itself requires to accept the pull request at all. Both
failure modes were confirmed empirically on `ivan-pinatti-labs/rsync-crypt`,
not assumed.

`bot-auto-merge.yml`'s `approve-owner` job is the fix: once `Pre-commit`,
`Pin Only` and `Review Verified` are all green, it supplies the approval
that makes the pull request queue eligible. It reads the owning account's
login from the `REPO_OWNER_LOGIN` repository variable rather than a
hardcoded literal, a fix carried over from `ivan-pinatti-labs/github-template`
after rsync-crypt's own copy baked the login in directly; this repository's
copy is set to `ivan-pinatti`, the personal account that opens pull requests
here even though the repository itself lives under the `ivan-pinatti-labs`
organization. `resolve-owner` fails loudly if that variable is ever unset,
rather than silently approving nothing.

The `approve-owner` job does not arm auto-merge, deliberately: the owner
still decides when to enqueue, which is the "check everything is fine, then
merge" step the rest of this pipeline takes away from nobody else. This
approval is not evidence a human read the diff; it is issued the moment the
three contexts settle, with no review of their content, which is exactly why
it waits for `Review Verified` rather than for `Pin Only` alone. A
contributor or a fork gets no approval from this job and still needs a
genuine human review, same as always.

`Review Verified` is realistically the slowest of the three contexts to
settle, since it waits on CodeRabbit's own review, which is why this job
also reacts to `coderabbit-gate.yml` finishing a run (a `workflow_run`
trigger, not `pull_request_target` alone), re-checking every open
owner-authored pull request each time rather than only the one that
happened to prompt it. See rsync-crypt's fuller document for why it is
`workflow_run` and not a `status` trigger on `Review Verified` itself
(`GITHUB_TOKEN` publishes that status, and GitHub does not start new
workflow runs from events a `GITHUB_TOKEN` creates).

## A dependency bot pull request

Renovate (`.github/renovate.json5`: `asdf`, `pre-commit`, `github-actions`,
`pip_requirements`) is the only dependency bot with write access to this
repository, and it opens pull requests unattended. It was not always the
only one: until 2026-09-08, Dependabot (`.github/dependabot.yml`) managed
the `pre-commit`, `github-actions` and `pip` surfaces, and Renovate managed
only `asdf`, the one format neither Dependabot ecosystem here could read.
`.github/dependabot.yml` is gone now, deleted rather than left disabled,
since this is a real consumer repository and not a template with a reason
to keep a dormant copy around; every surface it used to own moved to
Renovate's own native managers, which read the same files. For the ones
that are pin only:

1. **`Pin Only` is graded.** `scripts/assert-pin-only-diff.py` checks that
   every changed line differs from its counterpart in nothing but a
   version, in a pin position, across five allowed pin surfaces
   (`.tool-versions`, `.pre-commit-config.yaml`, `.github/workflows/`,
   `requirements.txt` and `tests/requirements.txt`), and
   `coderabbit-gate.yml` publishes its verdict as the `Pin Only` status. A
   number that is not a pin does not count as one.
2. **The approval is supplied, conditionally.** `bot-auto-merge.yml` waits
   for `Pin Only` to read `success` and then supplies the approving review
   branch protection requires. A diff that is not pin-only gets no approval
   and waits for a person, same as a major bump does.
3. **GitHub enqueues and merges it** once every required check, including
   `Review Verified`, is green and the approval is in place, the same as
   any other pull request. Renovate arms auto-merge itself
   (`platformAutomerge`) when it opens a pull request eligible for step 2
   above, which is what actually enqueues it; nothing in this pipeline
   enqueues a pull request on Renovate's behalf.

This repository's pip surfaces, `requirements.txt` and
`tests/requirements.txt`, were deliberately excluded from those five until
2026-09-03, so every pip bump failed `Pin Only` and was graded exactly like
a human pull request — under Dependabot, which managed pip at the time.
That exclusion was standing in for a test gate this repository did not
have. Now that `Tests` exists and exercises the pinned dependencies, both
requirements files are pin surfaces and a pip bump merges unattended like
any other, the same today under Renovate's `pip_requirements` manager as it
did under Dependabot's `pip` ecosystem before it. See
`scripts/assert-pin-only-diff.py`'s own docstring for the full reasoning; it
is not restated here. The Dockerfile's `FROM python:3.12-slim` pin stays
unmanaged (see `.github/renovate.json5`'s comment on `extends:`), so no bot
pull request ever touches it in the first place.

`scripts/coderabbit-review-verdict.py`'s bot lane resolves `Review Verified`
straight to `success` with the description "pin-only diff, nothing to
review" the moment `Pin Only` reads `success`, and CodeRabbit is never asked
for an opinion; see rsync-crypt's document, "What actually gets reviewed,
and what does not," for the fuller reasoning, unchanged here. Renovate's
`minimumReleaseAge: "7 days"` in `.github/renovate.json5` is this
repository's own copy of the actual defence against a release that is well
formed and malicious: `Pin Only` can tell a line changed nothing but a
version, but it cannot tell a good release from a backdoored one. Before
2026-09-08 Dependabot carried the identical seven day window as its own
`cooldown.default-days` on every one of its ecosystems, deliberately kept
equal to Renovate's, so a bump waited the same length of time regardless of
which bot proposed it; see `ivan-pinatti-labs/.github`'s `README.md`, "Both
bots wait seven days", for that history.

## `Review Verified`, and the bug it exists to fix

Ported unchanged in reasoning from rsync-crypt, itself ported from
`docker-torrent-box-with-vpn`: a green `CodeRabbit` check does not mean a
review happened, because CodeRabbit posts through the legacy commit status
API, which offers only `error`, `failure`, `pending` and `success`, with no
fifth state for "green, but not for the reason you think." An exhausted
review quota, a skipped draft, and an actual completed review all read
`success`. Three pull requests merged with no review having actually
happened on `docker-torrent-box-with-vpn` as a direct result (its #114).

`scripts/coderabbit-review-verdict.py`, published as `Review Verified` by
`coderabbit-gate.yml`, is the fix: it reads the actual description behind
the `CodeRabbit` status rather than its color, and grades in three lanes (a
draft is `pending`; a clean pin-only bot pull request is `success` with no
review at all; everything else is `success` only for the literal
description `Review completed`, `pending` while a review is queued or
running, and `failure` otherwise). See the script's own docstring for the
full reasoning behind each lane; it is the authoritative version, not this
document.

## Recovering a stuck `Review Verified`

`coderabbit-gate.yml`'s hourly schedule (`31 * * * *`, offset from
`coderabbit-review-queue.yml`'s `7 * * * *`, and from every other
repository's own hourly sweeps in this organization: rsync-crypt and
`.github` at `47`/`23`, `github-template` at `53`/`29`) is a real
mitigation, not a guarantee: GitHub's own documentation says scheduled
workflows on public repositories are deprioritized under load and can be
skipped outright rather than merely delayed, and rsync-crypt has already
seen it happen twice in a row against its own schedule. `workflow_dispatch`
on `coderabbit-gate.yml` is the manual recovery path, run by anyone with
write access, either against a single `pr_number` or, left blank, against
every open pull request at once. See rsync-crypt's fuller document,
"Recovering a stuck `Review Verified`, honestly," for the full reasoning; it
applies here unchanged.

`coderabbit-review-queue.yml`'s hourly nudge (`7 * * * *`) is what actually
gets CodeRabbit to look at a bot pull request whose `Pin Only` verdict
failed, since CodeRabbit never reviews a bot's pull request on its own: a
clean pin-only bump never reaches this nudge at all, because `Review
Verified` already resolved to `success` with no CodeRabbit involvement (see
"A dependency bot pull request" above). See rsync-crypt's `CLAUDE.md`,
"CodeRabbit silently ignores `@coderabbitai review` from a bot account," for
why that comment has to come from a human account, or from
`CODERABBIT_NUDGE_TOKEN` rather than the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and for
what to check before assuming a nudge is in flight.

## The merge queue

Branch protection on `main` requires `Pre-commit`, `Pin Only` and
`Review Verified`, one approval, dismissal of stale reviews, approval of the
last push, conversation resolution and a linear history. `enforce_admins`
is `false`, which matters for exactly one account: it lets the owner merge
without being blocked by rules an admin can bypass, but it does not exempt
the owner's own pull request from the approval the queue itself requires to
accept it, which is what makes "The repository owner's own pull request"
above necessary. `allow_auto_merge` has to be enabled, or the queue cannot
accept anything at all.

The merge queue ruleset (squash merges, `enforcement: active`) carries no
bypass actor, deliberately: `merge_group` triggers on `pull-request.yml` and
`coderabbit-gate.yml` exist so that every required context runs a second
time against the queue's own temporary commit before anything actually
merges, and a bypass actor would let a pull request skip that second run
entirely.

## The bootstrap gap this pipeline was ported through

`coderabbit-gate.yml` and `bot-auto-merge.yml` both trigger on
`pull_request_target`, which runs the workflow file from the **base**
branch, not the pull request's own branch. On the pull request that first
adds these files to this repository's `main`, they do not exist on the base
branch yet, so neither one runs and `Pin Only` / `Review Verified` cannot be
published on that pull request. Branch protection cannot require either
context on that pull request either, for the same reason. This is the same
bootstrap rsync-crypt's own document describes ("ported ahead of need...
every job below was inert"), and `ivan-pinatti-labs/github-template`'s
document names it as recurring every time this pipeline is carried into a
new repository. It recurred once more here: branch protection was left
unchanged (no `Pin Only`, no `Review Verified`, no merge queue ruleset)
until the pull request that added this pipeline had already merged to
`main`, and only then were both applied. Every pull request after that one
runs against the version of these files already on `main`, and the gap does
not reopen.
